This repository collects all my exercises, notes, codes, patches, resources and dirty tricks related to creative coding and generative art.

The repository is organized in the form of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. 

Materials directly created by me, are distributed under the MIT license, while those created by other authors are always accompanied by their original use license.
